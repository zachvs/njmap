	<h1>Public Transit Summary Map of N. New Jersey</h1>
	<h2 style="border-bottom: 1px solid #eee">(and other points west of the Hudson)</h2>

	<div id="missionstatement">
	<p>One thing that's annoyed me since I first moved to New Jersey
	is that it's very hard to understand how all the buses hook up. The
	schedules don't exactly give you a total picture of the system.</p>

	<p>Another problem is that the NJ Transit bus network is huge and
	complex, with buses criss-crossing urban areas and taking long trips on the
	freeway. Not to mention that buses operated by companies other than NJ Transit make up
	a significant part of the transit system.</p>

	<p>In making this map, I've reduced most towns to one or two stops for
	clarity, and dropped the smallest ones.
	I've omitted any line that doesn't run seven days a week, as well as many
	buses that don't run frequently during the day. And if
	your town can't be reached from New York, it's not on this map.</p>

	<p class="disclaimer">And that leads us to the
	<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>:
		This map was designed with the aid of custom software, and definitely
		contains errors. It should be used only as a guideline to understand
		transit options.

		Many stations and lines have been omitted or simplified.

		Not all buses make all stops. Always check schedules to verify exact
		itineraries before travel.
